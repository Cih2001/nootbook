\section{Implementing Memory Protection (Chapter 3.5) P $\rightarrow $102}
\begin{note}[Protection Through Segmentation]
The following checks are performed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Limit checks.
\item Segment-type checks
\item Privilege-level checks.
\item Restricted instruction checks.
\end{itemize}
All of these checks will occur before the memory access cycle begins. If a violation occurs, a general-protection exception (often denoted by \#GP) will be generated by the processor.
\end{note}

\begin{note}[Segmentation Protection : Limit Checks]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using 20-bit limit field of segment descriptors (in GDT or LDT) to ensure the program does not access the memory that isn't there.
\item Using GDTR's size limit to not allow access of entries that lie outside of GDT
\end{enumerate}
\end{note}
